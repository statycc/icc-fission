Those files were obtained by running the source-to-source compiler [AutoPar-Clava](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-019-03109-9/)  from [clava](https://github.com/specs-feup/clava) on the following 6 files from the polybench benchmarking suite:

- bicg.c
- fdtd-2d.c 
- gesummv.c
- jacobi-1d.c 
- jacobi-2d.c 
- mvt.c

after they have been annotated, as shared in [original_annotated](../original_annotated/).


The results were checked an found equivalent to the files produced by the authors at <https://zenodo.org/record/1889368>.
