# Polybench + pyalp

This is a reorganized version of [Polybench/C benchmark suite][PB] [version 4.2][4.2] 
with minimal changes and extensions, for purpose of timing pyalp transformations 
on these programs.

**Changes to original suite:**

1. The original benchmark program files are under `original/`
    - these are in a flat directory, unlike original source.
    
2. Headers moved to `headers` to enable sharing between the program directories
    - references to headers have been changed from e.g. `"2mm.h" -> <2mm.h>`

3. `time_benchmark.sh` changed to output results in tabular format

**Extensions:**

1. Parallel versions of programs in `parallel/` directory

    - These are manually transformed versions of the benchmark programs 
    - Filename schema:
        - Filename ends with `_og.c` =>  non-parallelizable/same as original version
        - Otherwise: file has been transformed and is parallelizable
        
2. `run.sh` script has been added 

    - this is a wrapper for the built-in timing script
    - enables timing entire directory at once
    - adds some useful argument flags

### How to time


**Basic usage**

This command executes using the default options listed below.
       
```text
run.sh 
```

<small>Note: use bash shell if on MacOS: `/bin/sh run.sh`</small>

**Available arguments**

```
-c  compiler                                    [default: gcc]
-d  directory to benchmark (parallel|original)  [default: original]
-o  optimization level e.g O3                   [default: O0] 
-s  skip programs that are not parallelizable   [default: false] 
-v  max. variance between timing results (%)    [default: 5.0] 
```

**Duration**

All programs: 30-40 min &nbsp; â€¢ &nbsp; parallelized only (`-s` flag): 3 min

### Results

The results can be found in `results/` directory. 

Two files will be generated for each run:

1. `[dir]_[timestamp]_model.txt` - machine + processor snapshot, meta data

2. `[dir]_[timestamp].txt` - actual results of timing

Data labels are: `program, variance (%), time (s)`.
Labels are always the same and not included in timing results file.

Timing options are same as default:

- perform 5 executions/program
- take average of 3 runs (exclude min, max time)
- dataset size is `STANDARD_DATASET`
